# Hello!

I'm Tim, a software development enthusiast and a full time student.
I enjoy working on React, NodeJS CLI, and GraphQL server projects, although, I'm also interested in artificial intelligence. TypeScript is currently my favorite language because how powerful and scalable of an abstraction it is.
C++ would also be in my top tier, because of the static typing system and how robust and efficient it is.
Python would be my choice for building small side projects and some data analysis stuff.
Sorry, but I'm not really into Java.
