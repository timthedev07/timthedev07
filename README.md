# Hello!

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=timthedev07&label=views&color=blue&style=flat-square)

I'm Tim, a software development enthusiast and a full time student from China.
I enjoy working on React, NodeJS CLI, and GraphQL server projects, although, I'm also interested in artificial intelligence.

## Language preferences

TypeScript is currently my favorite language because how of powerful and scalable of an abstraction it is.

C++ would also be in my top tier, because of the static typing system and how robust and efficient it is.

Python would be my choice for building small side projects and some data analysis stuff.

I'm just getting started with Swift, and I feel like it's really good(better than Java at least).

Sorry, but I'm not really into Java.

Also knows: JavaScript, and C.
